#Cover art collection
*A collection of cover art for various retro video game consoles.*

The current size of the repo is about 155mb, but is growing.

The currently-completed archives of console game art:

 - SNES
 - Sega Genesis / Sega Master System
 - NES

 There is presently partial art for a variety of other systems, with completion planned (as soon as I can locate the art!).
